Activity 2 was a lot harder compared to Activity 1 since we were implementing a lot more coding knowledge that we discussed inside and outside of class. Particularly functions, lists and loops. I particularly struggle with functions, as I kept doing the wrong indentations or my code would run but wouldn't print out whatever subject I wanted to. For example, in question \#9 of activity two, we had to create a function that greeted the person, "Hello, {person}\! Have a good day ahead. At first, I would just make the print (Hello, {person}\! Have a good day ahead) without assigning a variable to the person so my code wouldn’t run properly. I would also rock my brain about the indentation; it's kind of hard to indent when your just clicking the space bar over and over again trying to figure out the right space between the code. In question \#5, I wasn’t setting gender \== to women and men, so when I ran the cell, nothing would occur. In question \#7, I didn’t know that you had to write a counter on this line of code longlist\_professions\_count \=  
Counter(longlist\_professions), and when I did figure it out, I didn’t know that “counter” had to be upper case and kept experiencing the error NameError: name 'counter' is not defined. At the end of all this, I came to the conclusion that I would make a lot of mistakes while coding. I just have to be able to keep a calm mind while trying to debug instead of getting frustrated and making more mistakes.
