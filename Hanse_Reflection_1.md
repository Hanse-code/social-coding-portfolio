Learning python has been an eye-opening experience for me, as i have never had any coding experience prior to taking this data science class. I honestly expected it to be much more complicated than it has been so far, but I won't say it hasn’t met my expectations in terms of difficulty. If I were to summarize my experience so far, it would be “chaotic yet pleasing." It has been pretty fun to learn how to code and the different ways we can use code and data to make something out of nothing. Even though it has been frustrating to remember the material as there is so much information to learn. I feel as if if I don’t practice my skills on a regular basis, everything i learn so far would be thrown out the drain. 

The best example of this would be activity one, if terms of difficulty it was pretty low. However, i kept finding myself looking over my notes and different assignments we have done to complete the simple coding exercise. Which made me realize that its unrealistic to learn every minute detail and just focus on learning general terms. I also realize how important it is to be able to self learn and practice more outside of class.
