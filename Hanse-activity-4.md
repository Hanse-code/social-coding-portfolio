This Elden Ring-inspired Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game engages players through branching story paths that present meaningful choices and consequences. Players decide how to approach various situations, like fighting the Tree Sentinel or Godfrey. Each decision can lead to success or failure, encouraging replayability as players explore different paths and outcomes. The story also builds to a cliffhanger, hinting at challenges to come in Liurnia of the Lakes, keeping players intrigued for future adventures.

The design is simple yet effective, allowing players to shape their journey while maintaining a clear narrative. The game captures the essence of Elden Ring with a focus on exploration, survival, and discovery, with players encountering both allies and enemies. While it's a basic choose-your-own-adventure format, I believe it does a good job at using the plot device from the original game and creating some good tension. There's room for more complex features, such as RPG mechanics or deeper decision-making, but the current setup proves how a strong narrative can lead to an engaging experience.

As I was creating this code, I wanted to add more and more and realized that if I didn't, I might add the entire plotline of the game, so I decided to save myself after creating different scenes and going over the very beginning of the game.
