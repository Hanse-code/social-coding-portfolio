# Transatlantic slave trade dataset biography 

**Part 1** 

The transatlantic slave trade dataset is from approximately 1526 to 1867, which contains the data set of 12.5 million captured men, women, and children who were put on ships in Africa, and 10.7 million arrived in the Americas. The data set also contains thousands of names of shipowners and ship captains, with most of the millions of slaves having no name. This dataset was created in 1998 by David Eltis and David Richardson. The data contains the years, place of purchase, place of landing, the percentage of men, women, and children, and the number of people who embark and disembark.

**Question \#1**  
Black digital practices prioritize centering marginalized voices, particularly those of enslaved individuals, whose humanity and stories are often reduced to numbers in historical datasets like the Slave Voyages records. Jessica Marie Johnson, in “Markup Bodies,” argues that technology can perpetuate structures of erasure but can also be wielded to reclaim histories. When reading and working with the Slave Voyages dataset, Black digital practices challenge us to move beyond the abstraction of human lives into data points. For example Digital tools, such as mapping, textual analysis, or visualization

**Question \#2**  
Missing or incomplete data in the Slave Voyages records is more than a technical shortcoming; it reflects the violence and erasure embedded in the history of slavery. Jessica Marie Johnson reminds us that gaps in archives are not accidental—they are products of systems that dehumanized enslaved people and deliberately erased their identities.

**Question \#3**  
Data visualization techniques, such as maps, timelines, and bar charts, serve as powerful tools for presenting the patterns within the Slave Voyages dataset in a way that is more accessible, meaningful, and engaging for public audiences. By converting raw data into visual stories, we can convey complex historical trends clearly and effectively while respecting the importance of the human experiences represented in the data.
